<img src="docs/assets/images/OldSlidePrj.gif" alt="Sample header file">

## Overview

**Old Style Projector** is an FMX C++Builder application that simulates a vintage slide projector, complete with visual effects and sound.

It requires [Anafestica](https://github.com/gcardi/Anafestica/), a header-only library used to manage the persistence of application parameters such as App-wide settings and Forms' position.

## Features

- **Dual video output support**:
  Operates with two video outputs — one for the control panel, and the other for a digital projector or an external large-format display.

- **Single monitor mode**:
  Alternatively, it can run on a single monitor, with the output rendered in a standard Windows window.

- **Vintage-style simulation**:
  Includes effects and sounds that replicate the experience of a traditional slide projector.

## Requirements

- C++Builder with FMX support
- Anafestica (header-only library)
